## Plan on improving the project

**Welcome**

- The project was interesting and very informative, its a very good way to learn about new vital software engeneering skills.

* In my first project it i put the hours of work on the footer and i believe its a very fiting place for the hours info there alongside social media.

* I think there should be a Home clickable button that returns us immediately to the home section of the page instead of scrolling all the way up to the header section of the page.

* I noticed also that in the background image in the menu section the yellow cicrle is behind the text in the end of the line and in the start of the line the background is white, i think its prefable if the menu section had only one background-color behind the texts and not more, it makes it more pleasant to read.

## Conclusion

There are alot of things i need to learn in my path to become a software engeneer and im very excited .

Thank you for your time reading this page .
